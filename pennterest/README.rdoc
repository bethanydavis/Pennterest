== README
Signing up, logging in/out, making boards, and pinning to those boards should all be the basic features. I think being able to display pins based on different categories would be a good additional feature to make this project of appropriate scope
Features:
* Signing up

* Logging in/out

* Making boards

* Pinning to boards

* Displaying pins based on different categories
